# Angular applications with NgRx and Nx

The **enterprise-angluar** project will walk through a thorough introduction into using NgRx, an RxJS powered state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux. We will use Nx CLI and Nrwl Plugins, an open source toolkit for enterprise applications. Nx was designed to help you create and build enterprise-grade Angular applications with proven project structure and patterns.

- Angular mono repo architecture with the CLI and nx workspaces
- Building shared nx libraries with NgRx
- Redux and NgRx principles
- Angular fundamentals including components, routing, services and forms

# JSON-SERVER Setup

2. install JSON-SERVER in the root of your project
   ```
   npm install json-server --save-dev
   ```
3. make a new folder called "server" in the root of your project (e.g. nx-angular\server)
4. add a file call db.json for mock data (you can view the content of this file in the project)
5. add this command **"json-server": "json-server server/db.json"** to the package.json under the script section
   ```json
     "scripts": {
         "start": "nx serve",
         "build": "nx build",
         "test": "nx test",
         "json-server": "json-server server/db.json"
       },
   ```
6. run JSON-SERVER locally using command line
   ```
   npm run json-server
   ```
7. Navigate to localhost:3000 in the browser
